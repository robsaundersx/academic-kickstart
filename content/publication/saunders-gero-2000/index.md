abstract: "Emergence has become the focus of much attention in the design computing research in recent years as one of only a small number of design processes that can expand a design space and hence facilitate creative designing as defined by Gero (1990). This poster presentation examines the requirements for a computational model of design emergence and suggests that many existing computational systems lack the processes required to model design emergence. This poster proposes a process called adaptive novelty detection to support computational models of design emergence."
