 abstract = {This paper reports on a system for computational analogy-making based on conceptual spaces. The system constructs conceptual spaces that express the relationships between concepts and uses them to build new associations. A case for this conceptual-space driven model of association making is made, and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed. A prototype space-construction system is detailed and one method by which such a system could be used to make associations is proposed. The system forms concepts that are useful to describe a set of objects, then learns how those concepts relate to each other. These relationships can then be used to construct analogies.},
