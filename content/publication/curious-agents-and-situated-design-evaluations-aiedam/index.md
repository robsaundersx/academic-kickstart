abstract: "This paper presents a possible future direction for agent-based simulation using complex agents that can learn from experience and report their individual evaluations. Adding learning to the agent model permits the simulation of potentially important agent behaviour such as curiosity. The agents can then report evaluations of a design that are situated in their individual experience. The paper describes the architecture of curious agents used in the situated evaluation of designs. It then describes an example of the application of such curious agents in the evaluation of the curating of an exhibition in an art gallery."
