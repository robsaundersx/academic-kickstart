abstract: "A visualisation method is presented for interactive evolution of interactive software objects, in which multiple outputs of the system are used to construct a two-dimensional shape in a feature space. The method allows multiple phenotypes to be overlaid allowing for quick feedback on the different properties of phenotypes. The properties of the resulting visualisations are discussed."
