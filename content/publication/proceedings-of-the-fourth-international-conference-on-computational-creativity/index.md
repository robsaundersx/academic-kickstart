abstract: "The Fourth International Conference on Computational Creativity 2013 represents a growth and maturity of a conference series that builds on a series of workshops held over ten years and the first three international conferences: the first held in Portugal in 2010, the second held in Mexico in 2011, and the third held in Ireland in 2012. The purpose of this conference series is to make a scientific contribution to the field of computational creativity through discussion and publication on progress in fully autonomous creative systems, modeling human and computational creativity, computational support for human creativity, simulating creativity, and human/machine interaction in creative endeavors. Contributions come from many relevant disciplines, including computer science, artificial intelligence, engineering design, cognitive science, psychology, and art."
