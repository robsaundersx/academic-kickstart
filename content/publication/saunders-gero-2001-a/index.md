abstract: "This paper presents a ``curious design agent'', i.e. an agent that uses the search for novel designs to guide its design actions. A computational model of curiosity based on a process called novelty detection is presented. The behaviour of the computational model is illustrated with a curious design agent searching the space of two- dimensional patterns generated by a simulated Spirograph is reported."
