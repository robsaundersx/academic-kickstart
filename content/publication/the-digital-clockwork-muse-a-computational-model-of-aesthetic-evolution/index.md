abstract: "This paper presents a computational model of creativity that attempts to capture within a social context an important aspect of the art and design process: the search for novelty. The computational model consists of multiple novelty-seeking agents that can assess the interestingness of artworks. The agents can communicate to particularly interesting artworks to others. Agents can also communicate to reward other agents for finding interesting artworks. We present the results from running experiments to investigate the effects of searching for different degrees of novelty on the artworks produced and the social organisation of the agents."
