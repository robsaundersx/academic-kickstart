abstract: "Artists from 20 different countries push lace techniques in surprising new directions â€“ knitting human hair into sculptures of human organs, crocheting steel wire into a ghostly motor engine, carving lace patterns from the body of a rusty old truck. The book includes an essay by Powerhouse Museum curator Lindie Ward and an in-depth look at the creative process of 10 artists. It features a wraparound cover which folds out to a poster showcasing all the works and highlighting the winning entries."
