abstract: "This paper describes ongoing research into association-based computational creative systems. The necessary components for developing association-based creative systems are outlined, and the challenges in measuring the creativity of such a system are discussed. An approach to operationalising creativity metrics for association-based systems based on representational affordances is described. This approach is then demonstrated through an analysis of results produced by a system for constructing associations between visual designs."
