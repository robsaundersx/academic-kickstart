abstract: "Multiple devices, both hardware and software, may come and go at any time in a given room. Software controlling the behaviour of these devices must be able to adapt to encompass new devices or the removal of existing devices. This paper presents a model for curious, supervised learning agents that address the issue of adaptability at a behavioural level in an intelligent room. Curious, supervised learning agents comprise a curiosity module and a supervised learning algorithm. The curiosity module identifies interesting devices on which to focus the agentâ€™s learning. The supervised learning component realises behaviours by observing, modelling and mimicking human actions. Our framework is demonstrated in a virtual meeting room in *Second Life*. We show that the curious learning agent can adapt its behaviour to identify new learning goals in response to new devices and activities."
