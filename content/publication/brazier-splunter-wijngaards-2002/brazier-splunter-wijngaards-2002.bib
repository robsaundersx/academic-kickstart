 abstract = {Software agents operate in dynamic environments (Jennings, 2000). Within its environment an agent, however, may also be a dynamic artefact: a dynamic artefact that may autonomously decide to adapt, or to be adapted due to changes in its environment. These adaptations may be performed by the agent itself, i.e., a self-modifying agent, or by an external service, e.g., an agent factory. It may be up to the agent to choose the service provider. In all cases adaptive agents need to be prepared for adaptation when first created (e.g. compositional design is one of the prerequisites).

In evolutionary computation (Saunders and Gero, 2001) agents are often seen as individuals within a population, where individual agents can be adapted or combined to form new agents. An important difference between an agent factory and evolutionary computation is that the agent factory is based on explicit knowledge, and evolutionary computation on implicit knowledge or none at all (completely random).

The goal of this position paper is to discuss both approaches with respect to how evolution and adaptation are dealt with. Potential `crossovers' between the two approaches are explored.},
