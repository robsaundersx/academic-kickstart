Modelling artificial creative societies using large-scale multi-agent systems will support the computational simulation of cultural evolution and the development of novel support environments for online and distributed creative design communities. The computational modelling of the evolution of language in creative societies using a distributed multi-agent system approach has opened up new possibilities for exploring features of natural language that support creativity and the evolution of creative domains. Computational explorations of language as an active component in the creative process have demonstrated the possibility for developing new computational models of ‘specific curiosity’ that are closer to our common-sense notions of what it means to be curious using vector-space representations of words (e.g. word2vec, GloVe).
