The development of robotics artworks, Zwischenraume, Complicit and Accomplice has provided a test-bed for developing new approaches to embodied computational creativity that change their environment through action. Laboratory-based user experience studies have explored the dynamics between groups of embodied creative agents and human participants. Current research is exploring the acquisition of embodied ‘craft-like’ skills by robotic systems for the development of grounded models in mark-making processes. Applying computational models of intrinsic motivation and active learning of creative techniques in manufacturing robots will open up new possibilities for smart manufacturing in terms of the materials and techniques available. Early explorations of this have explored the development of suitable hardware and software and possible application to stone masonry.
